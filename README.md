// For LAB Testing Objects

1) The objects had no identifications, just bird with numbers and letters after. The toString method allows the program to grab the identities of the data variables and use them.
2) 3 fields, name age breed, null 0 and null.
3) Gave identities to the nulls and 0, gave descriptions to bird2
4) the @override tells the compiler user intends to override the method 
5) Private is preferred when the programmer doesn't want the users to change the codes, rather grab the info needed from it when asked, but not change.
